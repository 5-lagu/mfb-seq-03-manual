## 0. Introduction

MFB's SEQ-03 module is a step-sequencer which is equally suited to trigger drum modules as well as to play and control synthesizers. In addition, each of the 12 available tracks may serve as an AR-envelope or LFO.

## 1. Sequencer Modes
The SEQ-03 offers three operational modes that cover different applications:

**Mode 1** : This mode allows every track to be used either as CV- or gate-track, AR-envelope or LFO separately. Sequences can be up to four bars, or 64 steps, in length with an adjustable number of steps per bar. The speed, or clock division, is set globally for all tracks. Shuffle is available, but only for use with the internal clock or an external clock with 24 ppq resolution. Each track has a dedicated output jack.

**Mode 2** : This mode is similar to mode 1 but is fixed to one bar. In exchange, this mode allows for polyrhythmical patterns. Each track may have an individual number of steps as well as individual clock division. Shuffle is not available in this mode.

**Mode 3** : This mode is dedicated to controlling synthesizers with pairs of CV values and a fixed trigger per step. There are two outputs assigned per track. Track 1 uses jacks CG1 for CV and CG2 for trigger outputs, track 2 uses jacks CG3 for CV and CG4 for trigger outputs etc. Accordingly, this mode offers only six tracks, and the track types are fixed.

**Warning:** Switching operational modes forces the currently selected pattern to be initialized, and all programmed steps will be lost.

## 2. Setup

MFB's SEQ-03 is fully compatible with Doepferâ€™s A-100 modular system - in size, bus-power and CV/gate voltage. Connect the 10-pin MFB-cable to a corresponded 16-pin jack on the mainframe bus. Supply voltage needs to be +/- 12 volts. The wattage is +25/-5 mA, the module size is 20 HP (half pitches) equivalent to 101,3mm.

**Attention:** Please, check for correct polarity! The colored side of the connector-cable (-12 V) needs to point downwards!


## 3 General

We have been trying to develop a complex sequencer in a compact module format that is still easy to use. Hopefully, we have succeeded. However, it is still necessary for you to familiarize yourself with the basic principles of operating the SEQ-03.

The SEQ-03 will always be either in **Mute Mode**, where every track can easily be muted, or in **Record Mode**. This mode allows programming of the steps. In mute-mode the track-LED will be lit green, in record-mode the track-LED will be lit red.

By pressing **Shift** the red LEDs will always indicate the sequencer operational mode. **Step-LED 14** will additionally indicate the start-mode (see below).

By pressing the step-buttons, you may directly call up the functions **ClrBar**, **RemBar**, **ClrPatt**, **Init Patt**, **SeqMode1**, **SeqMode2**, **SeqMode3** and **StartMode** or a function with additional options to choose from. These shift-functions are **LastStep**, **ClkDiv**, **TrkMode**, **Direction**, **Quantize**, **LFOWave** and **Shuffle**. Here, the corresponding Step-LED and Shift-LED will be lit red. By using the step-buttons, the desired option can be selected until **Shift** is released to leave this menu.

## 3.5 Starting up (initial state)

Upon switching on the unit, the SEQ-03 will always enter **sequencer mode 1**. The **track-LED** will be lit green and the s **tep-buttons 1-12** can be used to mute the corresponding tracks. The initial sequence has a length of one bar. The BarUp-LED will be lit green, indicating that you are located in bar 1. The internal clock is initially selected and the clock- and start-jacks serve as outputs (to select an external clock, see clock settings). Press **Start** to start the sequencer.

## 4 Track types

The SEQ-03 offers four track types:

### 4.1 CV-track

## 5 Track mute

Press the **Track button** until the track-LED is lit green to exit recording mode and enter **Mute mode**. Now, tracks 1-12 can be muted using the corresponding **Step** buttons. A muted track is indicated by a red LED for that step.

**Note:** In sequencer modes 1 and 2, the 12 tracks can be muted using step-buttons 1-12 with the corresponding step LEDs being lit red. In mode 3 only six tracks are available. Use step-buttons 1-6 to mute these tracks.

## 6 Record mode

Pressing the **Track button** until the track LED is lit red to enter **Record mode**.

### 6.1 Selecting and programming a track

Select a track first by carrying out the following steps:

1. Press and hold **Track**
2. Select the track by pressing the corresponding **Step**  button
3. Release both buttons

The steps are set using the corresponding **Step** buttons. Press and hold **Select** to adjust several steps simultaneously. The **step-LED** of the step set last will flash green. While the **step-LED** is lit green, two parameters can be adjusted using the potentiometers **Para1/Para2**. With the parameters being set, select the next step to edit. Alternatively, press **Select** to avoid displacing the parameters.

### 6.2 Track parameters

The parameters that can be adjusted using **Para1** and **Para2** depend upon the track-type being selected

#### 6.2.1 CV
**Para1** : CV value, depending on the quantize-setting for the track:
 - 3, 5 or 7 octaves in semitones or
 - 0-8 volts with no quantization
**Para2** : Portamento (glide)

#### 6.2.2 Gate
**Para1** : Gate voltage, adjustable from 6.5 to ca. 9.5 volts (all MFB-drum-modules offer dynamic
triggering to control the output volume
**Para2** : Gate length, adjustment range 4-250ms

**Note:** Depending on the tempo, gates mayoverlap and merge two succeeding gate triggers into one.

#### 6.2.3 AR envelope
The envelopes use an exponential type of control. The maximum output is 8 volts.

**Para1**: Attack time, adjustment range: ca. 2.5-700ms
**Para2**: Release-time, adjustment range: ca. 2.5-700ms

#### 6.2.4 LFO
An individual waveform shape can be selected per LFO track, being valid for all steps of a track. However, the amplitude and the tempo can be set per step. A special feature is the non-existing neutral zero-line for the LFO which rather oscillates between zero volts and the defined maximum value (Para2). As with all other track types, parameters 1 and 2 are programmable. In addition, the LFO is reset with each step, making lively "LFO-sequences" possible.

**Para1**: Tempo, ca. 8s to 10Hz
**Para2**: CV amplitude, depending on the quantize-setting for the track:
 - 3, 5 or 7 octaves in semitones or
 - 0-8 volts with no quantization

### 6.3 Editing existing steps

Each programmed step can be edited at any time. In addition, it is also possible to edit multiple steps at once. This way, new steps as well as existing steps can be edited in one move.

1. Press and hold **Select
2.  Press all **step-buttons** for the steps to be edited, existing or new one
3. Release **Select
4. Adjust **Para1 and/or Para2**. All steps will now share the same value.
5. Press **Select** again to leave edit-mode. All **Step-LEDs** should now be lit permanently.

**Note:** With CV-tracks, the control voltage may not only be altered by the Para1-control but also using the **BarUp** and **BarDown** buttons. This action works relatively to allow transposing a full sequence up or down.


## 7 Working with bars

**Switching between bars**
Switch between bars using the **BarUp** and **BarDown** buttons.

**Copying bars**
Initially, a new pattern has a length of one bar. By pressing **BarUp**, the contents of the first bar will be duplicated (with bar 2 being selected), allowing to create fast variations. By pressing **Shift** and **BarUp**, an empty bar will be added instead of a copy of bar 1.

**Note:** This operation is only possible in operational modes 1 and 3.

Individual bars may also be deleted or shifted (see Shift-functions).

In record-mode, moving LEDs will indicate that the selected bar is currently played.

Both LEDs for **BarUp** and **BarDown** display the currently selected track:
 - BarUp green, BarDown off: bar 1
 - BarUp red, BarDown off: bar 2
 - BarUp off, BarDown green: bar 3
 - BarUp off, BarDown red: bar 4

## 8 Loading and saving patterns

The SEQ-03 allows storing a total of 48 patterns, being organized in three banks of 16 patterns each. To switch between banks carry out the following steps:

1. Press and hold **Shift
2. Pressing **LoadPatt** will advance the bank selection by one. The LED will display the currently selected bank.
3. Release **Shift-Taste** when the desired bank has been reached

**LoadPatt-LED**
Off: Bank 1 Green: Bank 2 Red: Bank 3

### 8.1 Loading Patterns

1. Press and hold **LoadPatt** - the last selected pattern is  indicated by a green step-LED
2. **Step** buttons 1-16 select the patterns of the current bank Release **LoadPatt** - the pattern will be switched upon the next bar

### 8.2 Saving patterns

1. Press and hold **SavePatt** - the last selected pattern is indicated by a green step-LED
2. **Step** buttons 1-16 select the patterns of the current bank 
3. Release **SavePatt** - the pattern is saved and the **SavePatt-LED** will flash red shortly

## 9 Shift-functions

### 9.1 Shift-functions with options

To adjust these functions carry out the following steps:

1. Press and hold **Shift**
2. Press the corresponding **Step** button to select a function
3. Release **Shift**
4. **Shift LED** + **Step LED** will flash red
5. Adjust the option using the **Step** buttons
6. Confirm by pressing **Shift**

#### 9.1.1 LastStep

Use step-button 1-16 to set the number of steps per bar. With the exception of **SeqMode2** this setting affects all tracks - no matter if in mute- or record-mode. In **SeqMode2** the number of
steps can be set per track. Depending whether you are in mute-or record-mode, all tracks or just the currently selected track will be adjusted.

#### 9.1.2 ClkDiv

The step buttons 1-16 are used to set the clock divider:

Step 1: 1 = 96th
Step 2: 2 = 48th
Step 3: 3 = 32th
Step 4: 4 = 16th triplets
Step 5: 6 = 16th
Step 6: 8 = 8th triplets
Step 7: 12 = 8th
Step 8: 16 = 4th triplets
Step 9: 24 = 4th
Step 10: 32 = 1/2 triplets
Step 11: 48 = 1/2
Step 12: 64 = 2/3
Step 13: 96 = 1
Step 14: 128 = 1 1/3
Step 15: 192 = 2
Step 16: 288 = 4

With the exception of **SeqMode2** this setting affects all tracks no matter if in mute- or record-mode. In **SeqMode2** the number of steps can be set per track. Depending whether you are in mute- or record-mode, all tracks or just the currently selected track will be adjusted.

#### 9.1.3 TrkMode

This function is only available in operational modes **SeqMode1** and **SeqMode2**. In **SeqMode3** all track-types are fixed (see SeqMode3). Depending whether you are in mute- or record-mode, all tracks or just the currently selected track will be adjusted.

Step 1: CV-track Step 3: AR-envelope
Step 2: Gate-track Step 4: LFO

#### 9.1.4 Direction

This option sets the order of the sequencer steps being played.

Step 1: up Step 3: alternating
Step 2: down Step 4: random

Depending whether you are in mute- or record-mode, all tracks or just the currently selected track will be adjusted.

#### 9.1.5 Quantization

This option sets the adjustment range for **Para**.

Step 1: 3 octaves, quantized in semitones
Step 2: 5 octaves, quantized in semitones
Step 3: 7 octaves, quantized in semitones
Step 4: not quantized, ca. 0-8 volts


Depending whether you are in mute- or record-mode, all tracks
or just the currently selected track will be adjusted.

#### 9.1.6 LFO wave

This option sets the waveform shape for a track being used as LFO in record-mode.

Step 1: saw tooth ascending
Step 2: saw tooth descending
Step 3: sine
Step 4: square

#### 9.1.7 Sync I/O

This option selects the clock source.

Step 1: internal clock, clock out: 16th, tempo control active
Step 2: internal clock, clock out: 24ppq
Step 3: external clock, 16th, gate: start/pause (startmode on => reset)
Step 4: external clock, 24ppq, gate: start/pause (startmode on => reset)

When you have a SEQ-03 from serial 2 (if the bar up key is right and the bar down key is left, on the first series the printing was swapped) there are two additional modes:
Step 5: external sync 16th, without start/stop input, the start/stop is a reset
Step 6: external sync 96th, without start/stop input, the start/stop is a reset

#### Shuffle............................................................................

This option sets the shuffle intensity by pressing step-buttons 1-16:

Step  1:    no shuffle
Steps 2-16: 15 shuffle-intensity

This function is only available in operational modes **SeqMode1** and **SeqMode 3**. With the clock source being set to external, Shuffle is only possible with Sync I/O-mode being set to external 24 ppq.

**Note:** ClockDiv should be set to 16th!

### 9.2 Shift-functions without options

To adjust these functions carry out the following steps:

1. Press and hold **Shift**
2. Press **Step**
3. Release both buttons
4. The function is carried out

#### 9.2.1 ClrBar

In record-mode, the current track will be deleted. In mute-mode, all steps of the current bar will be deleted in all tracks.

#### 9.2.2 RemBar

This function removes a bar. Here, the following bars are moved forward in time respectively. A sequence of originally four bar length will turn into a three bar sequence.

#### 9.2.3 ClrPatt

This function deletes all steps of the selected pattern. However, all track-settings such as TrkMode, Quantize, LFO Wave, LastStep, Direction and ClkDiv are being kept.

#### 9.2.4 InitPattern

This function initializes the selected pattern. Here, all steps are deleted and all track-settings are reset to their initial states.

#### 9.2.5 SeqMode1

The sequencer is set to operational mode 1.

#### 9.2.6 SeqMode2

The sequencer is set to operational mode 2.

#### 9.2.7 SeqMode3

The sequencer is set to operational mode 3.

**Note:** Switching operational modes forces the currently selected pattern to be initialized, i.e. all programmed step will be lost. To keep your pattern, please save in advance.

#### 9.2.8 StartMode

This function adjusts the behavior of the **Start/Stop-jack**. Depending on sync I/O setting, this jack serves as input or output.

Step-LED on:  DIN-sync mode
Step-LED off: MFB-mode
