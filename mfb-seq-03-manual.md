## 1 Introduction

MFB's SEQ-03 module is a step-sequencer which is equally
suited to trigger drum modules as well as to play and control
synthesizers. In addition, each of the 12 available tracks may
serve as an AR-envelope or LFO.

The SEQ-03 offers three operational modes that cover different
applications:

1. **Mode 1** : This mode allows every track to be used either
    as CV- or gate-track, AR-envelope or LFO. Sequences
    can be up to four bars in length with an adjustable
    number of steps per bar. The speed, i.e. clock division is
    set globally for all tracks. Shuffle is available but only
    for use with the internal clock or at external clock with
    24ppq resolution. Each track has a dedicated output.
2. **Mode 2** : The modus equals mode 1 but is fixed to a
    length of one bar. In exchange, this mode allows for
    poly-rhythmical patterns. Each track may have an
    individual number of steps as well as individual clock
    division. Shuffle is not available in this mode.
3. **Mode 3** : This mode is dedicated to control synthesizers
    when wanting to adjust CV values and gate-information
    per step simultaneously. There are two outputs assigned
    per track. Track 1 uses jacks CG1 for CV- and CG2 for
    gate output. Accordingly, this mode offers only six
    tracks. The track types are fixed in this mode.


**Note:** Switching operational modes forces the currently
selected pattern to be initialized, i.e. all programmed step will
be lost.

## 2 Setup.......................................................................................

MFB's SEQ-03 is fully compatible to Doepferâ€™s A-100 modular
system - in size, bus-power and CV/Gate voltage. Connect the
10-pin MFB-cable to a corresponded 16-pin jack on the
mainframe bus. Supply voltage needs to be +/- 12 volts. The
wattage is +25/-5mA, the module size is 20HP (half pitches)
equivalent to 101,3mm.

**Attention:** Please, check for correct polarity! The colored side
of the connector-cable needs to point downwards (-12 V)!


## 3 General....................................................................................

We have been trying to develop a complex sequencer in a
compact module format that is still easy to use. Hopefully, we
have succeeded. However, it is still necessary for you to
familiarize yourself with the basic principles of operating the
SEQ-03.

The SEQ-03 will always be either in **Mute Mode** , where every
track can easily be muted, or in **Record Mode**. This mode
allows programming of the steps. In mute-mode the track-LED
will be lit green, in record-mode the Track-LED will be lit red.

By pressing **Shift** the red LEDs will always indicate the
sequencer operational mode. **Step-LED 14** will additionally
indicate the start-mode (see below). By pressing the step-
buttons, you may directly call up the functions **ClrBar** ,
**RemBar** , **ClrPatt** , **Init Patt** , **SeqMode1** , **SeqMode2** ,
**SeqMode3** and **StartMode** or a function with additional
options to choose from. These so-called shift-functions are
**LastStep** , **ClkDiv** , **TrkMode** , **Direction** , **Quantize** , **LFO
Wave** and **Shuffle**. Here, the corresponding Step-LED and
Shift-LED will be lit red. By using the step-buttons, the desired
option can be selected until **Shift** is released to leave this menu.


## 4 First start - track types.............................................................

Upon switching on the unit, the SEQ-03 will always enter
**sequencer mode 1**. The **track-LED** will be lit green and the
s **tep-buttons 1-12** can be used to mute the corresponding
tracks. The initial sequence has a length of one bar. The BarUp-
LED will be lit green, indicating that you are located in bar 1.
The internal clock is initially selected and the clock- and start-
jacks serve as outputs (to select an external clock, see clock
settings). Press **Start** to start the sequencer.

The SEQ-03 offers four track types. Here is an exemplary
introduction...

### CV-Spur

To use track 1 as a CV-track, connect a cable to the **CG1** jack
output and patch it to the CV-input of another module, e.g. an
oscillator. Now, press **Start** to start the internal clock while

12.Repeat 9-11 to define further steps

## 5 Track Mute..............................................................................

Press the **Track button** repeatedly until the track-LED is lit
green to enter **Mute mode**. Now, tracks 1-12 can be muted
using the corresponding **Step** buttons. A muted track is
indicated by a red LED for that step.

**Note:** In sequencer operational modes 1 and 2 , the 12 tracks
can be muted using step-buttons 1-12 with the corresponding
step-LEDs being lit red. In operational mode 3 only six tracks
are available. Use step-buttons 1-6 to mute these tracks.


## 6 Record Mode.........................................................................

Pressing the **Track button** repeatedly until the track-LED is lit
red to enter **Record mode**.

**Selecting and programming a track**
Select a track first by carrying out the following steps:

1. Press and hold **Track**
2. Select the track by pressing the corresponding **Step**
    button
3. Release both buttons

The steps are set using the corresponding **Step** buttons. Press
and hold **Select** to adjust several steps simultaneously.
The **step-LED** of the step set last will flash green. While the
**step-LED** is lit green, two parameters can be adjusted using
the potentiometers **Para1/Para2**. With the parameters being
set, select the next step to edit. Alternatively, press **Select** to
avoid displacing the parameters.

### Track-Parameters

The parameters that can be adjusted using **Para1** and **Para**
depend upon the track-type being selected

**CV-track
Para1** : CV, depending on the quantize-parameter:
3,5,7 octaves in semitones or
0-8 volts with no quantization
**Para2** : Portamento


**Gate-track
Para1** : Gate-voltage, adjustable from 6.5 to ca.
9.5 volts, all MFB-drum-modules offer dynamic
triggering to control the output volume
**Para2** : Gate-length, adjustment range 4-250ms
**Note:** Depending on the tempo, gates may
overlap and merge two succeeding gate triggers
into one.

**AR-envelope**
The envelopes use an exponential type of control. The
maximum output is 8 volts.

```
Para1 : Attack-time,
Adjustment range: ca. 2.5-700ms
Para2 : Release-time,
Adjustment range: ca. 2.5-700ms
```
**LFO**
An individual waveform shape can be selected per LFO, being
valid for all steps of a track. However, the amplitude and the
tempo can be set per step.
A special feature is the non-existing neutral zero-line for the
LFO which rather oscillates between zero volts and the defined
maximum value (Para2). As with all other track types,
parameters 1 and 2 are programmable. In addition, the LFO is
reset with each step, making lively "LFO-sequences" possible.

```
Para1 : Tempo: ca. 8s to 10Hz
Para2 : CV, depending on the quantize-parameter:
3 , 5 or 7 octaves in semitones or
0-8 volts with no quantization
```

### Editing existing steps

Each programmed step can be edited at any time. In addition, it
is also possible to edit multiple steps at once. This way, new
steps as well as existing steps can be edited in one move.

**1.** Press and hold **Select
2.** Press all **step-buttons** for the steps to be edited,
    existing or new one
**3.** Release **Select
4.** Adjust **Para1 and/or Para2**. All steps will now share
    the same value.
**5.** Press **Select** again to leave edit-mode. All **Step-LEDs**
    should now be lit permanently.

**Note:** With CV-tracks, the control voltage may not only be
altered by the Para1-control but also using the **BarUp** and
**BarDown** buttons. This action works relatively to allow
transposing a full sequence up or down.


## 7 Working with bars.................................................................

**Switching between bars**
Switch between bars using **BarUp-** and **BarDown**.

**Copying bars**
Initially, a new pattern has a length of one bar. By pressing
**BarUp** , the contents of the first bar will be duplicated (with bar
2 being selected), allowing to create fast variations. By
pressing **Shift** additionally, just an empty bar will be added.

**Note:** This operation is only possible in operational modes 1
and 3.

Individual bars may also be deleted or shifted (see Shift-
functions).

In record-mode, moving LEDs will indicate that the selected
bar is currently played.

Both LEDs for **BarUp-** and **BarDown** display the currently
selected track:
BarUp green, BarDown off: Bar 1
BarUp red, BarDown off: Bar 2
BarUp off, BarDown green: Bar 3
BarUp off, BarDown red: Bar 4


## 8 Loading and saving sequences..............................................

The SEQ-03 allows storing a total of 48 patterns, being
organized in three banks of 16 patterns each. To switch
between banks carry out the following steps:

**1.** Press and hold **Shift
2.** Pressing **LoadPatt** will advance the bank selection by
    one. The LED will display the currently selected bank.
**3.** Release **Shift-Taste** when the desired bank has been
    reached

**LoadPatt-LED**
Off: Bank 1 Green: Bank 2 Red: Bank 3

### Loading Patterns..................................................................

1. Press and hold **LoadPatt** - the last selected pattern is
    indicated by a green step-LED
2. **Step** buttons 1-16 select the patterns of the current bank
3. Release **LoadPatt** - the pattern will be switched upon
    the next bar

### Saving patterns....................................................................

1. Press and hold **SavePatt** - the last selected pattern is
    indicated by a green step-LED
2. **Step** buttons 1-16 select the patterns of the current bank
3. Release **SavePatt** - the pattern is saved and the
    **SavePatt-LED** will flash red shortly

3. Release **Shift**
4. **Shift LED** + **Step LED** will flash red
5. Adjust the option using the **Step** buttons
6. Confirm by pressing **Shift**

#### LastStep..........................................................................

Use step-button 1-16 to set the number of steps per bar. With
the exception of **SeqMode2** this setting affects all tracks - no
matter if in mute- or record-mode. In **SeqMode2** the number of
steps can be set per track. Depending whether you are in mute-
or record-mode, all tracks or just the currently selected track
will be adjusted.

#### ClkDiv............................................................................

The step buttons 1-16 are used to set the clock divider:
Step 1: 1 = 96th Step 9: 24 = 4th
Step 2: 2 = 48th Step 10: 32 Â½ triplets
Step 3: 3 = 32th Step 11: 48 Â½
Step 4: 4 = 16th triplets Step 12: 64 2/
Step 5: 6 = 16th Step 13: 96 1
Step 6: 8 = 8th triplets Step 14: 128 1 1/
Step 7: 12 = 8th Step 15: 192 2
Step 8: 16 = 4th triplets Step 16: 288 4

With the exception of **SeqMode2** this setting affects all tracks -


no matter if in mute- or record-mode. In **SeqMode2** the
number of steps can be set per track.
Depending whether you are in mute- or record-mode, all tracks
or just the currently selected track will be adjusted.

#### TrkMode.........................................................................

This function is only available in operational modes
**SeqMode1** and **SeqMode2**. In **SeqMode3** all track-types are
fixed (see SeqMode3).
Depending whether you are in mute- or record-mode, all tracks
or just the currently selected track will be adjusted.

Step 1: CV-track Step 3: AR-envelope
Step 2: Gate-track Step 4: LFO

#### Direction.........................................................................

This option sets the order of the sequencer steps being played.

Step 1: up Step 3: alternating
Step 2: down Step 4: random

Depending whether you are in mute- or record-mode, all tracks
or just the currently selected track will be adjusted.

#### Quantization...................................................................
